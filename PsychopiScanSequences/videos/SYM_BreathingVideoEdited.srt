1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,220
You sit down now very comfortably

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,160
Now you have a desire; you put your attention to that!

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,140
Attention is very important, see?

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,030
So, the emotions are there

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,120
and then bring those emotions

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,150
and put them into your attention!

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,260
Means, they are

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,130
now you're aware of them!

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,140
Now, what you do is to watch your breathing. See now!

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,040
Try to reduce your breathing!

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,110
Reduce it

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,160
in the sense

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,020
that you have breathed out,

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,270
wait for a while,

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,040
then you breathe in

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,070
for a long time, then you breathe out.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,130
So in one minute

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,070
your breathing will be less than normal.

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,180
Alright? Try that! Breathe in! Now with the emotions!

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,020
Keep the attention on the emotions, you see,

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,030
so that the connection is established!

22
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,130
hmm

23
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,250
Better?

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,190
Now, when you are breathing

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,160
you find that there is a space in between

26
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,040
which you just leave it vacant! Breathe in,

27
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,220
now leave it vacant!

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,220
Now breathe out,

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,010
now leave it vacant!

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,130
Breathe in!

31
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,070
Keep it there!

32
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,030
And leave it,

33
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,170
keep outside!

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,260
Now breathe in!

35
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,260
Now start breathing in such a way that

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,210
you stop your breathing!

37
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,130
Attention should be on the heart or could be

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,150
on the emotions.

39
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,170
Better?

40
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,270
Keep the breathing inside for a while,

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,100
bring it out, then outside for a while, then again!

42
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,210
Then you'll find that for a while you will not breathe!

43
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,290
Hmm.. see? You settle down!

44
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,190
This exercise will give you this thoughtless awareness!

45
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,080
Establishment of thoughtless awareness! There is no thought!
