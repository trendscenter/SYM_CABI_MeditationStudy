00:00.050 --> 00:02.220
You sit down now very comfortably

00:03.070 --> 00:05.160
Now you have a desire; you put your attention to that!

00:05.160 --> 00:07.140
Attention is very important, see?

00:08.100 --> 00:12.030
So, the emotions are there

00:12.230 --> 00:14.120
and then bring those emotions

00:14.120 --> 00:16.150
and put them into your attention!

00:17.140 --> 00:19.260
Means, they are

00:20.120 --> 00:22.130
now you're aware of them!

00:23.160 --> 00:29.140
Now, what you do is to watch your breathing. See now!

00:30.200 --> 00:34.040
Try to reduce your breathing!

00:35.170 --> 00:36.110
Reduce it

00:39.170 --> 00:40.160
in the sense

00:42.140 --> 00:45.020
that you have breathed out,

00:45.180 --> 00:46.270
wait for a while,

00:47.060 --> 00:48.040
then you breathe in 

00:53.040 --> 00:55.070
for a long time, then you breathe out.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.130
So in one minute

00:58.140 --> 01:01.070
your breathing will be less than normal.

01:01.130 --> 01:06.180
Alright? Try that! Breathe in! Now with the emotions!

01:06.180 --> 01:09.020
Keep the attention on the emotions, you see,

01:09.040 --> 01:11.030
so that the connection is established!

01:41.190 --> 01:42.130
hmm

01:43.010 --> 01:44.250
Better?

01:50.020 --> 01:51.190
Now, when you are breathing

01:51.280 --> 01:54.160
you find that there is a space in between

01:55.050 --> 01:58.040
which you just leave it vacant! Breathe in,

02:00.140 --> 02:01.220
now leave it vacant!

02:03.240 --> 02:04.220
Now breathe out,

02:10.180 --> 02:12.010
now leave it vacant!

02:17.180 --> 02:18.130
Breathe in!

02:20.050 --> 02:21.070
Keep it there!

02:24.050 --> 02:25.030
And leave it,

02:29.170 --> 02:30.170
keep outside!

02:31.280 --> 02:32.260
Now breathe in!

02:41.010 --> 02:43.260
Now start breathing in such a way that

02:44.120 --> 02:45.210
you stop your breathing!

03:07.250 --> 03:11.130
Attention should be on the heart or could be

03:12.020 --> 03:13.150
on the emotions.

03:22.230 --> 03:23.170
Better?

03:29.070 --> 03:31.270
Keep the breathing inside for a while,

03:32.160 --> 03:37.100
bring it out, then outside for a while, then again!

03:37.100 --> 03:39.210
Then you'll find that for a while you will not breathe!

03:48.120 --> 03:50.290
Hmm.. see? You settle down!

03:52.160 --> 03:56.190
This exercise will give you this thoughtless awareness!

03:56.190 --> 03:59.080
Establishment of thoughtless awareness! There is no thought!
