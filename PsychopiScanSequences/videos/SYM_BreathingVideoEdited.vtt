00:00.050 --> 00:02.220
You sit down now very comfortably

00:03.070 --> 00:05.160
Now you have a desire; you put your attention to that!

00:05.160 --> 00:07.140
Attention is very important, see?

00:08.100 --> 00:12.030
So, the emotions are there

00:12.230 --> 00:14.120
and then bring those emotions

00:14.120 --> 00:16.150
and put them into your attention!

00:17.14 --> 00:19.26
Means, they are

00:20.12 --> 00:22.13
now you're aware of them!

00:23.16 --> 00:29.14
Now, what you do is to watch your breathing. See now!

00:30.20 --> 00:34.04
Try to reduce your breathing!

00:35.17 --> 00:36.11
Reduce it

00:39.17 --> 00:40.16
in the sense

00:42.14 --> 00:45.02
that you have breathed out,

00:45.18 --> 00:46.27
wait for a while,

00:47.06 --> 00:48.04
then you breathe in 

00:53.04 --> 00:55.07
for a long time, then you breathe out.

00:56.25 --> 00:58.13
So in one minute

00:58.14 --> 01:01.07
your breathing will be less than normal.

01:01.13 --> 01:06.18
Alright? Try that! Breathe in! Now with the emotions!

01:06.18 --> 01:09.02
Keep the attention on the emotions, you see,

01:09.04 --> 01:11.03
so that the connection is established!

01:41.19 --> 01:42.13
hmm

01:43.01 --> 01:44.25
Better?

01:50.02 --> 01:51.19
Now, when you are breathing

01:51.28 --> 01:54.16
you find that there is a space in between

01:55.05 --> 01:58.04
which you just leave it vacant! Breathe in,

02:00.14 --> 02:01.22
now leave it vacant!

02:03.24 --> 02:04.22
Now breathe out,

02:10.18 --> 02:12.01
now leave it vacant!

02:17.18 --> 02:18.13
Breathe in!

02:20.05 --> 02:21.07
Keep it there!

02:24.05 --> 02:25.03
And leave it,

02:29.17 --> 02:30.17
keep outside!

02:31.28 --> 02:32.26
Now breathe in!

02:41.01 --> 02:43.26
Now start breathing in such a way that

02:44.12 --> 02:45.21
you stop your breathing!

03:07.25 --> 03:11.13
Attention should be on the heart or could be

03:12.02 --> 03:13.15
on the emotions.

03:22.23 --> 03:23.17
Better?

03:29.07 --> 03:31.27
Keep the breathing inside for a while,

03:32.16 --> 03:37.10
bring it out, then outside for a while, then again!

03:37.10 --> 03:39.21
Then you'll find that for a while you will not breathe!

03:48.12 --> 03:50.29
Hmm.. see? You settle down!

03:52.16 --> 03:56.19
This exercise will give you this thoughtless awareness!

03:56.19 --> 03:59.08
Establishment of thoughtless awareness! There is no thought!
