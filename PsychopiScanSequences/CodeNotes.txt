TODOs:

1. Remove frame rate message.
    Possbile Options:
    a) DIDNT WORK.. Probably set expInfo['frameRate']=60 which is the default frame rate in the code
    b) Set a variable in the my_eeg_fmri_helper_functions.py and use that value in expInfo['frameRate']=60
    c) Just remove the display message and let the rest of the code function as is..

    https://discourse.psychopy.org/t/removing-attempting-to-measure-frame-rate-of-screen-please-wait-message/37435/4

    Currently, there seems to a bug in the code.. Discuss with Krishna and make changes as follows:
        a) Set a variable in my_eeg_fmri_helper_functions.py (PSYCHOPY_EXP_DEFAULT_FRAMERATE=60) and use the following
           line where it is checking in code mentioned in quotes " if win._monitorFrameRate is None:"
            win._monitorFrameRate=hf.PSYCHOPY_EXP_DEFAULT_FRAMERATE

2. Check image sizes and video sizes on the screen
3. Add subtitles to SYM Video
4. Add banner to SYM Video (make it same as presentation)


Coding COMPLETED BUT to test with RCS server:
1. Make sure all aversive and non-aversive do not show consequetively
2. Clicking Escape need to save eeg data; close rcs server before quitting
3. Renamed utils.py --> my_eeg_fmri_helper_functions.py
4. Check if ESCAPE key saves EEG recording data and  closes all the relevant ports/server connections.
5. Add 30s before starting the experiments
6. Add 30 extra in the end after finishing experiments
7. Check sleep() timings in RCS connections code.. if they work as expected

#####################
After generating python code from Psychopy.. need to make the following code additions manually

Inside main() :

1.  before run() method
    port, outlet, rcs, rcs_recording_flag = hf.eeg_setup(expName, expInfo.get('participant'))

2. after run() method
    hf.eeg_at_close(port, outlet, rcs, rcs_recording_flag)

3. inside endExperiment() lastline (May not be needed.. just recheck after connecting with RCS Server)
    hf.eeg_at_close(port, outlet, rcs, rcs_recording_flag)
