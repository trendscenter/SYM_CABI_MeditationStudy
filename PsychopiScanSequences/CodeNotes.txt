TODOs:
0. Currently testing EEG With 32-channel workspace. Need to change to 64-channel EEG Workspace during experiments.
1. Check image sizes and video sizes on the screen
2. Add subtitles to SYM Video
3. Add banner to SYM Video (make it same as presentation)

Coding COMPLETED BUT to test with RCS server:
1. Make sure all aversive and non-aversive do not show consecutively
2. Clicking Escape need to save eeg data; close rcs server before quitting
3. Renamed utils.py --> my_eeg_fmri_helper_functions.py
4. Check if ESCAPE key saves EEG recording data and  closes all the relevant ports/server connections.
5. Add 30s before starting the experiments
6. Add 120s extra in the end after finishing experiments
7. Check sleep() timings in RCS connections code.. if they work as expected
8. Removed frame rate message.

##################### Manual Code Changes #############
After generating python code from Psychopy.. need to make the following code additions manually

1.  Inside main() : before run() method
    port, outlet, rcs, rcs_recording_flag = hf.eeg_setup(expName, expInfo.get('participant'))

2. Inside main() : after run() method
    hf.eeg_at_close(port, outlet, rcs, rcs_recording_flag)

3. Search for 'if expInfo is not None' and
    a) place the following line just above the if statement
       win._monitorFrameRate = hf.PSYCHOPY_EXP_DEFAULT_FRAMERATE
    b) place the following line after the if block
       print(f'Current frameRate: {expInfo["frameRate"]}')


4. Inside main() : inside endExperiment() lastline (May not be needed.. just recheck after connecting with RCS Server)
    hf.eeg_at_close(port, outlet, rcs, rcs_recording_flag)


##################### Other Notes #############
Regarding frameRate message removal:
    Currently, there seems to a bug in the code.. Discuss with Krishna and make changes as follows:
        a) Set a variable in my_eeg_fmri_helper_functions.py (PSYCHOPY_EXP_DEFAULT_FRAMERATE=60) and use the following
           line where it is checking in code mentioned in quotes "if expInfo is not None:"
            win._monitorFrameRate=hf.PSYCHOPY_EXP_DEFAULT_FRAMERATE

    Previously tried the following options:
    a) DIDNT WORK.. Probably set expInfo['frameRate']=60 which is the default frame rate in the code
    b) Set a variable in the my_eeg_fmri_helper_functions.py and use that value in expInfo['frameRate']
    c) Just remove the display message and let the rest of the code function as is..
    d) Online suggestions for this:
